<h2>Interest in IT</h2> 
<p>My interests in IT revolve around interactive activities and digital entertainment, which is just a fancy way of saying I like to play video games 
and come up with ideas for future ones I hope to see or now as i study, hope to develop personally. I do enjoy the development of applications that serve humanity 
in different ways since my partner is diabetic I have also taken an interest in medical programs that help ease certain health restrictions like diabetes,
Asthma and even heart disease issues.  </p>

<h2>Ideal Job</h2>
<p>My ideal job is in the gaming and application development now australia has a small market for these but i found a job here i would love to get into. </p>

<p>This job to me seems like i would be working with a large group and helping oversee projects big and small in the gaming industry which 
in itself could be a rather fun if demanding job setting in its early phase, the skills needed would be a large understanding of IT, a moderate 
to expert understanding of programming and project management and therfore qualifications in Gaming and Entertainment would be the perfect direction to move through, 
my current expeirience is a very basic grasp on coding and how IT works so out of a hundred id say i have about 10/100 skills necessary to be a part of this industry. 
I plan to take several more undergrad courses revolving around IT and digital media and then move into a full on university degree in Gaming and Entertainment in 
order to give myself a better chance at building my career and lead into the linked job or jobs of a similar field. </p>
